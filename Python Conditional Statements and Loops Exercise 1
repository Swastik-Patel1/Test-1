## Python Conditional Statements and Loops Exercise 1
## Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included)

numList = []
for i in range(1500, 2701):
    if i % 7 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        numList.append(i)
        
for i in numList:
    if i == numList[-1]:
        print(i)
    else:
        print(i, end = ",")
